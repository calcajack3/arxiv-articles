    <div><ol>
<li><strong>What is achieved?</strong></li>
<p>An interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers is developed with two distinctive features: active prediction of user input and automatic construction of a custom user interface. The system acts as a learning-apprentice software-agent, characterizing the syntax and semantics of the user's information.</p>

<li><strong>How it is done?</strong></li>
<p>The system incorporates a machine learning component that learns from the user's input to predict and generate completion strings. It also constructs a user interface tailored to the user's needs. The user records information directly on a computer, while an agent behind the interface provides defaults and assists in constructing the custom user interface.</p>

<li><strong>Why it is important?</strong></li>
<p>This note-taking system enhances the efficiency and flexibility of recording information compared to traditional paper-based methods. By leveraging machine learning and automation, it predicts and assists the user in real-time, making the process more intuitive and seamless. The system's ability to automatically construct a custom user interface further enhances the user experience and productivity.</p>

    <div><ol>
<li><b>What is achieved?</b></li>
<p>The paper presents a novel approach called Wrap-Up, which is a trainable information extraction (IE) discourse component. It makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among extracted information from unrestricted text.</p>

<li><b>How it is done?</b></li>
<p>Wrap-Up utilizes machine learning to acquire knowledge for higher level IE processing. It automatically decides the classifiers needed and derives the feature set for each classifier. It is fully trainable and does not require manual customization for each domain.</p>

<li><b>Why it is important?</b></li>
<p>The approach addresses the need for efficient information extraction systems in handling the vast amounts of online text. By automating the decision-making process and feature set derivation, Wrap-Up streamlines the IE processing and achieves performance comparable to partially trainable modules that require manual customization. This advancement can contribute to more accurate and efficient analysis of unrestricted text.</p>

        style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: 700;margin-bottom: 1rem;">Flexibly Instructable Agents</div>
    <div><b>What is achieved?</b>
The paper presents an approach called "situated explanation" that enables an agent to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from interactive tutorial instructions. This approach combines analytic and inductive techniques to support flexible instructability.

<b>How it is done?</b>
The approach combines explanation-based learning, which is situated for each instruction, with contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. It is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar, which learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions.

<b>Why it is important?</b>
The approach addresses three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems. It allows the agent to accept known or unknown commands at any instruction point, handle instructions for current or hypothetical situations specified in language (e.g., conditional instructions), and learn each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks from instructions. This flexibility makes tutorial instruction a powerful paradigm for teaching tasks to agents.</div>
